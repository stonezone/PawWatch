# Future Features Wishlist

These items are out of scope for the current validation push but captured here so we can prioritize once battery/accuracy are proven.

## Hardware & Tracking
- Geofencing alerts (safe zone + leave/enter notifications)
- Multi-pet support with per-pet profiles/photos
- Training mode: tap-to-trigger haptic + optional walkie-talkie voice playback on the watch
- Offline storage + sync once phone reconnects

## Health & Safety
- Continuous health monitoring (heart rate ranges, movement trends, fatigue alerts)
- Fall detection / abnormal stillness alerts
- Integrations with pet medical records (vaccination reminders)

## Owner Experience
- Shared access for multiple family members
- Live trail replay + timeline scrubber
- Notification modes (silent/vibrate/voice)
- Cloud sync + optional web dashboard

Feel free to append ideas as they surface; once Phase 1 passes we can triage this list into roadmap milestones.
